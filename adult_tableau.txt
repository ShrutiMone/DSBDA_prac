0) Initial Setup
Open Tableau and click “Text File” (if CSV) under Connect.

Navigate to and select your adult.csv file.

Tableau will show a preview—verify that columns like age, workclass, education, income, native.country, sex, etc. have the correct data types (blue = dimension, green = measure).

a) Income Class of People with “Master’s” and “Doctorate” Education
New Sheet → name it “Income by Master’s/Doctorate.”

Drag education to the Filters shelf.

In the dialog, check Master’s and Doctorate only → OK.

Drag income to Columns.

Drag Number of Records (automatically generated) to Rows.

On the Marks card, select Bar.

Sort Descending by the bar height.

(Optional) Drag income to Color to differentiate “<=50K” vs “>50K.”

Rename title to “Income Distribution for Master’s & Doctorate”.

b) Income Class of People Who Have Private Jobs
New Sheet → “Income for Private Workclass.”

Drag workclass to Filters, select Private → OK.

Drag income to Columns, Number of Records to Rows.

Choose Bar on the Marks card.

(Optional) Color by income.

Title it “Income Distribution for Private Sector”.

c) Yearly Sales Comparison
Note: The Adult dataset has no “year” or “sales” fields. If you intended to compare a numerical measure over categories, replace with e.g. “Average Hours per Week by Education Level” or similar. Otherwise this specific chart isn’t applicable here.

d) Country‑Wise Statistics on a Map
New Sheet → “Country Map.”

Double‑click native.country → Tableau will build a map.

On the Marks card, change type to Map.

Drag Number of Records to Size (bigger circles for more people).

(Optional) Drag income to Color to show proportion of high‑ vs low‑income by country.

Title it “Population by Country” (or “Income by Country”).

e) Age‑wise: Education vs. Income
You want to see how income splits by education across ages. One approach is a scatter or a heat‑grid:

New Sheet → “Age × Education vs Income.”

Drag age to Columns.

Drag education.num (or education) to Rows.

On Marks, select Square (for a crosstab heat‑map).

Drag Number of Records to Color (darker = more people).

Drag income to Label or Color (if you prefer two‑color “<=50K” vs “>50K” impact).

Title it “Age vs Education: Income Distribution”.

f) Country‑wise Male/Female Ratio
New Sheet → “Sex Ratio by Country.”

Drag native.country to Columns.

Drag Number of Records to Rows.

Drag sex onto Color (Tableau will stack bars by male/female).

Sort countries by total height or alphabetically.

Title it “Male vs Female Population by Country”.

(Optional) Format as Stacked Bar in the Marks card.

g) Income Class Based on Workclass (Gov’t vs Other)
Create a Calculated Field called Sector with:

sql
Copy
Edit
IF [workclass] = 'Federal-gov'
  OR [workclass] = 'State-gov'
  OR [workclass] = 'Local-gov'
THEN 'Government'
ELSE 'Other'
END
New Sheet → “Income by Sector.”

Drag your new Sector to Columns.

Drag Number of Records to Rows.

Drag income to Color (to split <=50K vs >50K).

Set Marks to Bar.

Title it “Income Distribution: Government vs Other”.

Putting It All on a Dashboard
Click New Dashboard.

Drag each sheet into the layout.

Add dropdown Filters (e.g. Country, Education) to the dashboard for interactivity.

Arrange titles and legends neatly; size containers to avoid scrolling.

Save or publish your dashboard.
